ttofu
=====

A Tofu clone for terminal.

Tofu is a nice MacOS programm that displays documents as smoothly readable columns. I dearly miss it, since I moved to Linux :(

ttofu aims to bring the functionaltiy of Tofu to the terminal. I'll start with an absolute minimum of features. You'll just be able to choose the width of columns as a parameter. Then ttofu will read from stdin and display the text in columns. 'q' will quit the programm and the 'left' and 'right' buttons will move the display one column to left or right.

We'll see what I'll add in the future.
